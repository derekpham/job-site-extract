# job-site-extract
This is a firefox extension for the NuCareers website (Northeastern's).
It's intended to extract the job information and send it to my local database.
It should also stop NuCareers from switching to a new tab when opening a job (a very annoying feature).

Hopefully, there will be a simple website soon to display all the jobs info extracted.
